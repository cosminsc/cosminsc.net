               <p>Hi! I'm Cosmin. I'm an experienced full-stack web developer primarily interested in WordPress development together with HTML, CSS standards and Javascript libraries &amp; frameworks.</p>
               <p>I am a trusted person, responsible and able to learn new skills in a relatively short time. Last but not least I like challenges, that's why I'm not looking for excuses but for solutions in all the challenging problems I encounter. As I like to say: "as long as there is a problem, definitely there is also a solution".</p>
               <p>My main goal is providing high quality of all projects I'm involved in.</p>
