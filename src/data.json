            "description": "Cosmin is simply amazing! Incredibly talented designer and hard worker. I hired him because he took the initiative to send me a mockup of a design I needed before I even formally hired him. His attention to detail and ability to follow my often confusing directions and turn around the work very quickly makes him a superstar! I have already hired him for other projects and he will be my go-to designer for all future projects."
